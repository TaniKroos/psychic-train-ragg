Historically, the\nGreen Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s marked a turning point, leading to increased\ncrop yields through the adoption of high-yielding varieties, irrigation, and modern\nfarming practices. Subsequently, the Indian government introduced schemes like the\n\u201cNational Agricultural Policy in 2000\u201d, fostering a comprehensive approach to\nagricultural development. However, the present study focuses on the integration of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) into Indian agriculture, which has shown great promise in\nenhancing productivity and sustainability. AI-powered machines and tools, such as\nautonomous tractors, drones for precision farming, and data-driven decision support\nsystems, have become increasingly prevalent. These technologies enable farmers to\nmake data-informed choices related to crop management, pest control, and resource\nallocation. The results are notable, with increased crop yields, reduced resource\nwastage, and enhanced income for farmers. Achievements in the field are visible\nthrough success stories of AI-adoption in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Maharashtra.\nAdditionally, references to government initiatives like the \u201cNational Mission on\nSustainable Agriculture (NMSA)\u201d and the \u201cPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana\n(PMFBY)\u201d demonstrate the government's commitment to modernizing the agricultural\nsector. The study thus serves as a testament to the evolving landscape of Indian\nagriculture and the potential of AI to further revolutionize the industry.\nAI-driven solutions, leveraging machine learning algorithms, remote sensing, and data\nanalytics, have empowered farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding planting,\nirrigation, and pest control."}, {"id": 7, "username": "oscar", "text": "Organizations like the \u201cInternational Crops Research\nInstitute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)\u201d and startups like CropIn have been\nat the forefront of these advancements, developing AI tools that help farmers optimize\ncrop production and resource utilization.

AI technologies have applications that\ncan be customized to cater to the unique needs and crops specific to various regions of\nIndia, Prakash et al. (2013).\nNorth India (Wheat and Rice): The Indo-Gangetic Plains of North India predominantly\ncultivate wheat and rice. AI-driven precision farming techniques help in optimizing\nirrigation, fertilization, and pest control. These technologies can monitor soil moisture,\ncrop health, and weather conditions to make real-time recommendations, ensuring\nhigher yields and resource efficiency, report by The Economic Times (2023).\nPunjab and Haryana (Wheat and Paddy): These states are known for wheat and paddy\ncultivation. AI can be used for early disease detection, enabling timely intervention to\nprevent crop losses. Drones equipped with AI-driven cameras can monitor large fields\nand identify areas where crops may be under stress.\nAI algorithms predict pest outbreaks based on weather and environmental data, allowing\nfarmers to apply pesticides judiciously and reduce environmental impact. AI is also\nused for automated ginning and sorting of cotton, improving quality and reducing\nmanual labor for Cotton production in Gujarat and Maharashtra. In Maharashtra, known\nfor grapes and sugarcane, AI applications are used to optimize the supply chain,\nensuring the efficient transportation and storage of perishable crops."}, {"id": 10, "username": "oscar", "text": "This contrasts with\nthe logistics needs of states like Uttar Pradesh, where AI helps manage the distribution\nof potatoes and wheat.\nSoil health is a key factor in crop productivity. AI-based soil testing and analysis are\nemployed differently in states growing crops such as tea in Assam and pulses in\nMadhya\nPradesh.\nThese\ntools\nprovide\ncustomized\nrecommendations\nfor\nsoil\namendments, ensuring optimal conditions for crop growth.\n1.6\nUse of Agriculture By-Products in Health Sector\nAgricultural by-products can be used in various ways in the health sector to promote\nwell-being and address health-related challenges. Here are some examples of how\nagricultural by-products can be utilized in the health sector:\nCrop Residues: Crop residues, such as stalks and husks, can be processed to extract\nvaluable compounds. For example, rice bran, a by-product of rice milling, contains\ngamma-oryzanol and tocotrienols that have potential health benefits, including\ncholesterol reduction and antioxidant properties.\nWheat bran[24]: Wheat bran is a rich source of dietary fiber, which has been shown to\nhave a number of health benefits, such as reducing cholesterol levels, regulating blood\nsugar levels, and promoting digestive health. Wheat bran can also be used as a bulking\nagent in foods, which can help to increase satiety and reduce calorie intake.\nRice bran: Rice bran is a good source of antioxidants, including vitamin E, ferulic acid,\nand oryzanol. These antioxidants can help to protect cells from damage and may have a\nrole in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Rice bran\noil is also a good source of phytosterols, which can help to lower cholesterol levels.\nSoybean hulls[21]: Soybean hulls are a good source of insoluble fiber, which can help to\npromote digestive health."}, {"id": 11, "username": "oscar", "text": "Soybean hulls can also be used as a bulking agent in foods.\nFruit peels: Fruit peels are a good source of antioxidants, such as flavonoids and\nphenolic acids. These antioxidants can help to protect cells from damage and may have\na role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Fruit\npeels can also be used as a source of natural flavors and colors in foods.\nGrape pomace[25]: Grape pomace is the solid residue that remains after grapes have been\npressed to make wine. Grape pomace is a good source of antioxidants, including\nresveratrol. Resveratrol has been shown to have a number of health benefits, such as\nreducing the risk of heart disease and cancer. Grape pomace can also be used as a source\nof dietary fiber.\nFig 1: Grape Pomace[25]\nCoffee silverskin[26]: Coffee silverskin is the thin layer of skin that is removed from\ncoffee beans during the roasting process. Coffee silverskin is a good source of\nantioxidants, including chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid has been shown to have a\nnumber of health benefits, such as reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity.\nFig 2: Coffee Silverskin[26]\nTea waste[24]: Tea waste is the solid residue that remains after tea leaves have been\nbrewed. Tea waste is a good source of antioxidants, such as catechins. Catechins have\nbeen shown to have a number of health benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart\ndisease and cancer. Tea waste can also be used as a source of natural flavors and colors\nin foods.\nFig 3: Tea Waste[24]\nWhy India Lacks behind in implementing AI in the Agriculture sector?\nIndia is a major agricultural producer, with the sector employing over half of the\ncountry's workforce."}, {"id": 12, "username": "oscar", "text": "However, the adoption of AI technologies in Indian agriculture has\nbeen slow compared to other countries, Victor Mokaya (2019).\nLack of data: AI models are trained on large datasets, and the availability of relevant\nagricultural data in India is limited. This is due to a number of factors, such as the lack\nof standardized data collection methods, the reluctance of farmers to share their data,\nand the poor quality of existing data.\nInfrastructure challenges: The rollout of AI technologies in agriculture requires a robust\ntelecommunications infrastructure. However, many rural areas in India lack reliable\ninternet connectivity, which can hinder the adoption of AI-powered solutions.\nCost of technology: The cost of AI hardware and software can be prohibitive for\nsmallholder farmers, who make up the majority of farmers in India. Additionally, the\ncost of training farmers on how to use AI technologies can be a barrier to adoption.\nLack of awareness: Many farmers are unaware of the potential benefits of AI in\nagriculture. This is due to a lack of outreach and education programs on the topic.\nCultural barriers: There is a cultural barrier to the adoption of new technologies in some\nparts of India. This can be due to a lack of trust in new technologies or a preference for\ntraditional farming methods.\nDespite these challenges, there are a number of initiatives underway to promote the use\nof AI in Indian agriculture. The government has launched a number of programs to\nsupport the development of AI-powered agricultural solutions. Additionally, a number\nof startups are developing AI-based solutions for farmers.\nFor example, the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur has developed a mobile app\nthat uses AI to identify pests and diseases in crops."}, {"id": 13, "username": "oscar", "text": "The app can also provide farmers\nwith advice on how to manage pests and diseases.\nAnother example is the startup DeHaat[35], which has developed a platform that connects\nfarmers with agricultural experts. The platform uses AI to provide farmers with\npersonalized advice on crop selection, irrigation, and fertilization.\nFig 4: DeHaat Startup[35]\nThe adoption of AI in Indian agriculture is still in its early stages, but there is growing\npotential for AI to play a major role in transforming the sector."}, {"id": 14, "username": "oscar", "text": "As the challenges to\nadoption are addressed, AI is likely to become a more widely used tool for improving\nagricultural productivity and sustainability in India.\nLimited Productivity: Indian agriculture often faces issues related to low yields,\ninefficient\nresource\nmanagement,\nand\ninadequate\naccess\nto\nadvanced\nfarming\ntechniques, leading to lower productivity levels.\nClimate Uncertainty: Climate change has made Indian agriculture more vulnerable to\nunpredictable weather patterns, which can result in crop failures and income instability\nfor farmers.\nResource Scarcity: The availability of critical resources like water and arable land is\ndecreasing, making it imperative to optimize their use and enhance resource efficiency\nin farming.\nPest and Disease Management: Inefficient pest and disease control measures can lead\nto significant crop losses and financial strain on farmers.\nLack of Knowledge and Training: Many farmers lack access to modern agricultural\nknowledge and training, preventing them from adopting advanced technologies and\npractices.\nChapter 2\nLITERATURE REVIEW\nSNO.\nAUTHOR, YEAR, JOURNAL\nTITLE\nFINDINGS\n1.\n\u201cSheshadri Chatterjee, Emerald\nPublishing Limited,

Earlier studies in this domain have focused on\noptimizing crop yields, resource management, and pest control through AI-driven\nsolutions. Initiatives like the \"National Mission on Agricultural Extension and\nTechnology\" (NMAET) have sought to leverage AI for the benefit of Indian farmers\n(NABARD, 2020). Moreover, precision agriculture and data-driven decision-making have\nseen substantial growth with the proliferation of AI technologies, contributing to improved\nproductivity and sustainability (Dwivedi et al., 2020). Past studies have laid the foundation\nfor AI in agriculture in India. Notable works by authors like Rathore et al. (2018)\nhighlighted the use of machine learning algorithms for crop yield prediction, while Pandey\net al. (2018) explored the potential of AI for pest and disease management. Further\nresearch by Kumar et al. (2019) emphasized the role of AI in precision agriculture,\nfacilitating efficient resource utilization. These past efforts have led to remarkable\nachievements. The development of AI-based applications such as CropIn, a startup\nfounded by Krishna Kumar, has played a pivotal role in the digitization of Indian\nagriculture."}, {"id": 33, "username": "oscar", "text": "CropIn uses AI and satellite imagery for crop monitoring and management.\nAdditionally, the \"Kisan Suvidha\" app by the Indian government empowers farmers with\nAI-driven advisory services for crop cultivation.\nAs for past developments, AI applications such as predictive analytics, satellite imagery\nanalysis, and machine learning-based disease detection systems have helped farmers\nmake informed decisions about crop planting, irrigation, and pest management (Kumar\net al. 2019). AI-driven technologies like chatbots and mobile apps have also enhanced\nfarmers' access to information on weather forecasts and market prices, leading to more\nefficient resource utilization and crop marketing (Arora et al. 2020).\nTechnologies in drones are quickly gaining trust among farmers by providing new ways of\nincreasing\ncrop\nyields\nthrough\nin-\ndepth\nanalysis,\nlong-distance\ncrop\nspraying\nand\nhigh-efficiency crop analysis. Practical applications for drone technology are becoming more\nprevalent, therefore it is likely that drone-powered solutions will be on the notch over the next\nfew years. Drone based solutions in the agriculture sector have a lot of implications like dealing\nwith adverse climatic conditions, productivity gains, precision farming and crop yield\nmanagement.\nPlatforms like Jivabhumi's 'Food print' aggregates and traces farm produce, and offers a digital\nmarketplace. It uses blockchain technology to connect farmers and institutional buyers via an\nefficient and traceable supply chain (Baruah, 2019).\nIn the current scenario, AI's role in Indian agriculture has continued to evolve. AI-powered\ndrones, for instance, are being used for crop monitoring, and machine learning algorithms have\nbeen developed to predict crop diseases based on visual symptoms (Thakur et al. 2021).\nGovernment initiatives like the \"Digital India\" program have further encouraged the adoption of\nAI technologies, and several startups are offering AI-driven solutions to address the diverse\nchallenges of the sector, from soil health assessment to crop yield prediction (NITI Aayog,\n2020)."}, {"id": 34, "username": "oscar", "text": "In the present landscape, AI in Indian agriculture is witnessing ongoing work in several\nkey areas. Authors like Gupta et al. (2021) have focused on using AI to predict market prices\nand optimize supply chains, reducing post-harvest losses. Meanwhile, projects like Microsoft's\n\"FarmBeats\" are exploring the use of AI and IoT to provide data-driven insights to farmers.\nFurthermore, the use of AI in image recognition for disease and pest detection, as studied by\nRathi et al. (2020), holds immense potential to bolster crop health. The deployment of drones\nand AI for soil health assessment and irrigation management, as researched by Arora et al.\n(2020), is another promising avenue of development.\nUSE OF EXPERT SYSTEM\nAn expert system is a computer program created to mimic how human experts in a particular\nfield or domain solve problems. In order to create a structure that better meets the specific on-site\nneeds of farmers, expert structures in agriculture combine the knowledge of several disciplines,\nsuch as plant pathology, entomology, horticulture, and agricultural meteorology (Prasad and\nBabu, 2006).\nThe diagnostic, prediction, and farm management models are among the farm-related\nproblem-solving models that are the main focus of agriculture's expert system. A farmer may be\nable to communicate with the system in their native tongue and receive a solution to the given\nproblem using this expert system (Rafea et al. 1993). The farmer can use the keyboard to type a\nquery or interact visually, and the system will respond by displaying it on the screen.\nUSE OF ARTIFICIAL NETWORK\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are computer systems that attempt to mimic the\nbiological neural networks that make up human brains in order to solve complex\nproblems (Thyagarajan, 1998; Marchant and Onyango, 2002)."}, {"id": 35, "username": "oscar", "text": "To develop an ANN\nsystem, at least three layers are usually needed: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the\noutput layer. The study's particular problem will determine how many hidden nodes are\npresent. According to Kaul et al. (2005), the input nodes match the input variables, and\nthe output nodes match the output variables. The input layer is responsible for allocating\ninputs to several hidden layers, each of whose outputs is linked to an output layer where\nunit outputs are connected to the subsequent unit's inputs by connection weight\n(Marchant and Onyango, 2002).\nAgriculture has been using artificial neural networks for a while now for a variety of\napplications,\nincluding\nyield\nprediction (Drummond et al. 1995), agricultural\neconomics (Chen, 2005), weed identification (Zhang et al. 1994), crop nutrition\ndiagnosis (Song and He, 2005), modeling the terminal velocity of agricultural seeds\n(Ghamari et al., 2010), combine harvester control (Hall and Lu, 1992), etc.\nUSE OF FUZZY LOGIC\nIn order to deal with imprecision, vagueness, and inadequate knowledge, fuzzy logic is\nemployed. Expert systems can function at their best with unknown or ambiguous data\nand information thanks to fuzzy logic. Fuzzy expert systems use fuse logic as an\nalternative to conventional Boolean logic.\nIn essence, a fuzzy set is one whose members can have membership degrees ranging\nfrom 0 to 1. This is in contrast to classical sets, where an element's membership degree\ncan only be either 0 or 1, meaning that if it is 0, it is completely outside the group; if it\nis 1, it is inside the group. Rather than employing traditional Boolean logic and a set of\nmembership functions and rules to reason about data, fuzzy expert systems use fuzzy\nlogic. They handle ambiguous or imprecise information and are geared toward\nnumerical processing."}, {"id": 36, "username": "oscar", "text": "When combinations of conditions result in conclusions, IF-THEN\nrules are applied to the terms of the linguistic variables (Abraham, 2005).\nTABLE 4: GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES AND STARTUPS FOR DEEPER INTEGRATION OF\nAI IN AGRICULTURE\nPROJECT\nNAME\nPROBLEM/\nOBJECTIVE\nSOLUTION/ APPROACH\nIMPACT/\nIMPLEMENTATION\nAI sensors to\nmake farming\nsmarter\nIndia has embarked\non\na\njourney\nto\nbring\nAI\nsensors\ninto the agriculture\nfield.

This \nwould promote a more active learning environment and allow interns to consolidate \ntheir understanding before moving on to advanced topics. \n \n \n5. Enhanced Learning Resources\u200b\nProviding centralized access to curated learning resources, such as internal \ndocumentation, recorded sessions, recommended reading, and tech-specific tutorials, \nwould support self-paced learning. Although we were guided well by mentors, having \nan internal portal or wiki where such material is organized and regularly updated \nwould be especially helpful when encountering new tools or frameworks during \nproject work. It would also reduce the time spent searching for solutions and increase \nproductivity. \n \n6. Post-Internship Career Guidance\u200b\nLastly, incorporating a post-internship career guidance session would be a valuable \naddition to the program. Many interns are on the threshold of entering the professional \nworld and may benefit from mentorship on resume-building, interview preparation, \nspecialization choices (frontend, backend, DevOps, etc.), and long-term growth within \nthe tech industry."}, {"id": 95, "username": "oscar", "text": "A dedicated session or even a panel discussion with senior \nDepartment of Electronics and Communications Engineering, BPIT\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n41 \n \ndevelopers or alumni could inspire interns and help them make informed career \ndecisions. \n \n7. Conclusion\u200b\nIn summary, Xceedance already offers a strong internship framework with meaningful \nresponsibilities, structured training, and mentorship. These suggestions aim to further \nelevate the experience by ensuring continuous improvement and holistic development. \nWith a few enhancements in feedback structure, interdepartmental exposure, project \nonboarding, and resource accessibility, the internship program can become even more \nimpactful for future batches. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment of Electronics and Communications Engineering, BPIT\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n42 \n \nBibliography \n \n \n \n[1] Xceedance, \u201cXceedance \u2013 Insurance Technology Company,\u201d Xceedance, \n[Online].
